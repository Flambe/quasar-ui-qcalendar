## Everything you need for a complete Calendar solution.

QCalendar is a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) component. It is a powerful calendar that plugs right into your Quasar application and allows for viewing of **day** (1-7 days for a week), **monthly**, **scheduler** and **agenda** views. Painstaking care has been given to make almost every aspect of QCalendar configurable and/or modifiable in some way and control given to the developer.

# QCalendar v4.0.0 Alpha
Welcome to the QCalendar v4.0.0 Alpha release

### QCalendar is now converted to use Vue v3

> Until the final stable version is released, some aspects of the calendar may change.
